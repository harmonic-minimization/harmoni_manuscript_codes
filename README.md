<h3>Abstract</h3>

Investigating CFS in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) is hampered by the presence of spurious neuronal interactions due to non-sinusoidal waveshape of brain oscillations. Such waveshape gives rise to the presence of oscillatory harmonics mimicking genuine neuronal oscillations. Until recently, however, there has been no methodology for removing these harmonics from neuronal data. 

Here, we introduce a novel method (called HARMOnic miNImization - Harmoni) that removes the signal components which can be harmonics of a non-sinusoidal signal. Harmoniâ€™s working principle is based on the presence of CFS between harmonic components and the fundamental component of a non-sinusoidal signal. 

Using Harmoni, one can build conenctivity maps, in which the effect of harmonics are minimized.
